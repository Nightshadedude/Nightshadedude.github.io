// This program illustrates the use of a sentinel in a while loop.
// The user is asked for monthly rainfall totals until a sentinel
// value of -1 is entered. Then the total rainfall is displayed.

Exercise 4: Complete the program above by filling in the code described in the
statements in bold so that it will perform the indicated task.
**Completed inline per comments. 

Exercise 5: Run the program several times with various input. Record your
results. Are they correct? What happens if you enter â€“1 first? What happens
if you enter only values of 0 for one or more months? Is there any numerical
data that you should not enter?
**

Exercise 6: What is the purpose of the following code in the program above?
if (month == 1)
cout << "No data has been entered" << endl;
