      Well I made it 1200 miles already, and I passed
      through some interesting places on the way: Walla Walla, WA
      , Magic City, ID, Bountiful, UT, Last Chance, CO, Why, AZ,
      and Truth or Consequences, NM.

      I saw some Burma Shave style signs on the side of the road today: 
      ”Passing cars, When you can’t see, May get you, A glimpse,
      Of eternity“.  I definitely won’t be passing any cars!
