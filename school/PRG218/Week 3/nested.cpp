// This program finds the average time spent programming by a student
// each day over a three day period.

Exercise 1: Note that the inner loop of this program is always executed exactly
three timesâ€”once for each day of the long weekend. Modify the code so
that the inner loop iterates n times, where n is a positive integer input by
the user. In other words, let the user decide how many days to consider
just as they choose how many students to consider.
***Completed

Exercise 2: Modify the program from Exercise 1 so that it also finds the average
number of hours per day that a given student studies biology as well as
programming. For each given student include two prompts, one for each
subject. Have the program print out which subject the student, on average,
spent the most time on.
***Completed
